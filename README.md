# KarpeLiber

⚠︎ Under Construction ⚠︎

A flexible index management application for books, with links to
online libraries.  Developed for the University of Michigan's
[Regents' Proceedings Index](https://regents.umich.edu/archives/).

## Name

The name *KarpeLiber* is based on the Latin phrase "carpe liber",
which means "seize a book".  It was inspired by the well-known Latin
phrase, "carpe diem", which means "seize the day".  This application
enables the user to search the indices of many volumes, then they
can "seize a book".

Technically, to be similar to the syntax of "carpe diem", the correct
Latin phrase would be "carpe librum".  Not being well-versed in
Latin, this wasn't realized until considerable progress had been
made on the project.  By that time, it wasn't convenient to rename
the project, installations, hostnames, etc.  So, justification for
the imperfect name can be taken from the idea that the user may
take ***a book***, but it may not be ***the book*** they ultimately
need.  They may need to take ***another book***.  ("Carpe alius
liber"?)
